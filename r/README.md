## Overview

The **gstlearn** R package is a cross-platform R package wrapping the [gstlearn C++ Library](https://gstlearn.org). It offers to R users **all famous Geostatistical methodologies** developed and/or invented by the Geostatistic Team of the [Geosciences Research Center](https://www.geosciences.minesparis.psl.eu/)!

All *gstlearn* outputs can be ploted using *plot* generic function which relies on *ggplot* package.


## References

## Documentation

### C++ & R

The *gstlearn* R package is generated using a particular version of SWIG [see here}(https://soft.mines-paristech.fr/cran/gstlearn.html). Knowing the R platform, you probably know more about Rcpp package. We have chosen SWIG in order to mutualize the wrapper code of *gstlearn* C++ library for several different target languages.

The classes and functions documentation is provided with the *gstlearn* C++ library as html files generated by Doxygen. Please, refer to *gstlearn* C++ library API [See here]](https://gstlearn.org/) for more details. Only the *public* methods are exported by SWIG and must be considered in the R package.

Their is currently no R documentation for the *gstlearn* R package. The user can refer to the C++ documentation and have to learn how to adapt the code into R language following these "conversion rules":

* C++ classes are automatically converted into S4 classes. After creating an instance of an S4 class, methods (i.e. class function) must be called using `$` slot applied to the instance (i.e. an object) of that class (see `addColumns` in the example above which is a method of the class `Db`).

* If you ask for the class type of a *gstlearn* object under R (e.g. `class(mygrid)`), you will obtain the C++ class name prefixed with '_p_' (e.g. `_p_DbGrid`).

* Static C++ methods (e.g. `createFromNF` method in `DbGrid` class) defined in a class (e.g. `DbGrid`) are renamed by joining the class name and the method name (e.g. `DbGrid_createFromNF'`). Note: Static methods do not apply to object instances (e.g. `mygrid$createFromNF()` has no sense)

* Static C++ variables (e.g. `X` locator) defined in a class (e.g. `ELoc` 'enum' class) must be accessed in R using special functions named following the same rules as static methods (e.g. `ELoc_X()` in example above)

* All basic C++ types (`double`, `int`, `bool`, etc...) are automatically converted to/from R native types (`numeric`, `integer`, `logical`,...) (e.g. see `var` variable in the example above)

* `VectorDouble`, `VectorInt`, etc... C++ classes are automatically converted to/from R vectors (e.g. `c(1,2,3)`)

* `VectorVectorDouble`, `VectorVectorInt`, etc... C++ classes are automatically converted to/from lists of R vectors (e.g. `list(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))`)

* Some classes of the *gstlearn* C++ library have been extended in R:
  * `[]` operator permits to access content in a `Db` and a `DbGrid` in the same way as a R `dataframe`. (e.g. `mygrid["var1"]`, `mygrid[10,10]`).
  * But remind that a `Db` object is not a `data.frame` and `names(mygrid)` is not possible. To display all variable names of a `Db` instance, you need to use `mygrid$getAllNames()`.
  * Almost all classes are 'stringable' (those which inherit from `AStringable`), that means that you can type the object name in the R console prompt and hit 'Enter' key to obtain a detailed description of the object content. The same output text is obtained using the `display` method (e.g. `mygrid$display()`)
  * Some classes have an additional R method named `toTL` (i.e. 'to Target Language') that permits to convert an object into the corresponding R type. For example, the instruction `df = mygrid$toTL()` permits to create a R `data.frame` from a `Db` object. In that case, the newly created `data.frame` will contain all variables from the Db (but locators and grid parameters (for DbGrid) will be lost)

### RGeostats to gstlearn

For people who were using [RGeostats](http://cg.ensmp.fr/rgeostats), here is the description of some new concepts introduced in *gstlearn*. We are currently working hard to improve the user experience. Some of the following differences are drawbacks that will be fixed in a close future.

* The objects manipulated through *gstlearn* R package (Database, Variograms, Polygons, etc...) are now **external pointers*.

* If you need to duplicate your objects, a simple assignment (e.g. `db2 = db1`) is not possible. You must use the `clone` method by doing this: `db2 = db1$clone()`. All classes that inherits from `iCloneable` have this capability.

* The *gstlearn* objects memory content is not stored in the R workspace anymore. This means that saving the R workspace (`.RData`) is dangerous because it stores only memory pointers that won't be valid when loading the workspace in a future R session.

* People who want to recover the objects content for a future R session, have to save them to 'Neutral Files' using `dumpToNF` method before quitting R. All classes that inherits from `ASerializable` have this capability. The following R code explains how to create a 'Neutral File' and load it later:

```
# Create a Neutral File storing mygrid content
mygrid = DbGrid_create(c(10,10), c(1,1))
mygrid$dumpToNF("mygrid.backup") # This could produce an error - see below
#...
# Restart the R session
#...
# Load the Neutral File and recreate mygrid
mygrid = DbGrid_createFromNF("mygrid.backup")
```

### Known caveats

When executing a method using the `$` slot, if you experience the following error...

```
Erreur dans validObject(.Object) : 
  objet de classe “MethodWithNext” incorrect: Error : C stack usage  7972404 is too close to the limit
```

... there are two possible reasons:
* You made a mistake in the method name
* R cannot find the method because it is defined in an inherited class (for example `dumpToNF` is a method from `ASerializable` and currently `mygrid$dumpToNF` produces this error. In that case, you still can use the generic function behind the method by calling:

```
ASerializable_dumpToNF(mygrid, "mygrid.backup")
```

## Developments

### Requirements

For building the *gstlearn* R package, the requirements for building *gstlearn C++ library* must be installed beforehand. Then, the following additional tools must be also available:

* SWIG 4.2.0 **customized by Fabien Ors** (not the official version!)
* R 4.2 or higher
* RTools 4.2 or higher (for Windows users only)
* *ggplot2* and *ggpubr* R packages [Optional] (only for plotting)
* *knitr* and *callr* R packages [Optional] (only for testing R Markdown scripts)

If you modified your system (or if you installed a new version or RTools), you must reinstall the requirements from scratch following next instructions. You must delete 'gstlearn' and 'swig' existing source folders (if so).

Note :

* In case of issues, see [Important Notes below](#important-notes).

Note :

* These instructions for MacOS are currently not tested - above packages may not exist

#### Windows

1. Install *gstlearn C++ library* requirements for Windows (RTools) [here](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn#windows---mingw-via-rtools)

2. Remove any previous installation of SWIG (if any)

3. Launch *mingw64.exe* in RTools installation directory (i.e.: `C:\rtools42`) and pin the icon to the task bar

````
pacman -Sy bison
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-pcre2
````

4. In a directory of your choice, get the source of SWIG 4.2.0 [customized] by executing following commands (in the same shell):

### Installation from Source

1. For getting the *gstlearn* R package sources files, just clone the github repository:

````
git clone https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn.git
cd gstlearn
````

Next time, you will only need to pull the repository (If you have some local undesirable modifications, you have to revert them and execute the pull, otherwise do not execute `git reset`):

````
cd gstlearn
git reset --hard
git pull
````

2. Then, these instructions will compile and install the *gstlearn* R package in your usual R libraries directory:

````
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DBUILD_R=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target r_install
````

or even faster:

```
make r_install
```

### Execute Non-regression Tests

The `check*` targets bring some required runtime customization, so do not use the standard *ctest* command for triggering the non-regression tests.

To build and launch non-regression R tests, you need to execute the following command:

```
cmake --build build --target check_r
```

or even faster:

```
make check_r
```

### Important Notes

* Under Linux or MacOS, if you don't have sudo permissions, you may have to install swig in a folder of your choice. In that case, use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/user/Programs/swig4.2.0b` (adapt installation folder) in the `cmake` command above.
* If your system distribution repository doesn't provide minimum required versions, please install the tools manually (see provider website)
* If you experience the following issue: `Error: ERROR: no permission to install to directory...`, we suggest you to run the `install.packages` command (at least one time). This will create a *personal R library folder* having writing permissions.
* If you plan to generate the documentation, add `-DBUILD_DOXYGEN=ON` to the first cmake command above. Then users will be able to execute `make doxygen`.
* If you don't know how to execute github commands or you experience a 'password authentication' problem, you may [read this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
* Under Windows, using RTools is mandatory for compiling R packages
* Under Windows, you may need to add `-G "MSYS Makefiles"` to the first cmake command above
* If you want to build and install the *Debug* version, you must replace `Release` by `Debug` above
* You may need to precise the location of Boost, SWIG, Doxygen or HDF5 installation directory. In that case, add the following variables in the first cmake command above:
  * `-DBoost_ROOT="path/to/boost"`
  * `-DSWIG_ROOT="path/to/swig"`
  * `-DDoxygen_ROOT="path/to/doxygen"`
  * `-DHDF5_ROOT="path/to/hdf5"``

### Remove Installed Package

Execute the following command from an R command prompt:

```
remove.packages("gstlearn")
```
