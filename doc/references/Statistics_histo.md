### Histogram

To have a good idea of the distribution of a variable, one can compute the histogram.

The idea is 

* divide the range of the variable $[min,Max]$ into small intervals. Here, we only treat the case were all intervals have the same size
* compute the number of samples in each interval.


Normalized histogram rescales the ordinate such as the total surface is equal to 1.
