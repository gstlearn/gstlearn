This document describes the use of valgrind to evaluate the time
spent in the different parts of the software.

For example, to test the module 'name.cpp':

- compile and link the target program: the result is called 'name.out'. 
  You DO NOT HAVE to use any debugging parameter
  For example, if 'name.cpp' stands in tests/cpp, then the result is located in
  build/tests/cpp/Release

- run valgrind with the following syntax:
  valgrind --tool=callgrind ./'name.out'
  This creates a local file named 'callgrind.out.xxx'
  
- check the graphs of time expenses with the following syntax:
  kcachegrind 'callgrind.out.xxx'
