This note is meant to memorize the workflow that can be run manually
to check the quality of the documentation in add-ons written in R
with documentation written with Roxygen syntax (such as plot.R)

We notice that the r_install command is creating internally an R package
(in build/r/Release/gstlearn directory) that can be considered as a tentative R package.
In particular this directory contains the recommanded sub-directories
(R, src) and the recommanded files (DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE).

1) We must clean this pseudo package from the undesirable files: these are the files 
   rgstlearn_wrap.cxx, gstlearn.R and zzz.R contained in subdirectory R
   
2) In the top directory (build/r/Release/gstlearn), we can open R session
   and simply type:
   
   		devtools::check_man(".")
   		
This lists all the problems encountered in the Roxygen documentation of the pseudo-package.
