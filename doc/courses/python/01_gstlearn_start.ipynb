    "The *gstlearn* Python package is generated using SWIG [See here](https://pypi.org/project/gstlearn). We have chosen SWIG in order to mutualize the wrapper code of *gstlearn* C++ library for several different target languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes and functions documentation is provided with the *gstlearn* C++ library as html files generated by Doxygen. Please, refer to *gstlearn* C++ library API [See here](https://gstlearn.org/) for more details. Only the *public* methods are exported by SWIG and must be considered in the Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their is currently poor Python documentation for the *gstlearn* Python package. The user can refer to the C++ documentation and have to learn how to adapt the code into Python language following these \"conversion rules\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* C++ classes are automatically converted into Python classes. After creating an instance of a class, methods (i.e. class function) must be called using `.` applied to the instance (i.e. an object) of that class (see `db.display()` in the example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Static C++ methods (e.g. `createFromNF` method in `DbGrid` class) defined in a class (e.g. `DbGrid`) are renamed by joining the class name and the method name (e.g. `DbGrid.createFromNF`). Note: Static methods do not apply to object instances (e.g. `mygrid.createFromNF()` has no sense)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Static C++ variables (e.g. `X` locator) defined in a class (e.g. `ELoc` 'enum' class) must be accessed in Python using the same rules as static methods (e.g. `ELoc.X`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* All basic C++ types (`double`, `int`, `bool`, etc...) are automatically converted to/from Python native types (`float`, `int`, `bool`,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The C++ classes `VectorDouble`, `VectorInt`, etc...  are automatically converted to/from Python/numpy nd.array\n",
    "\n",
    "* The C++ classes `VectorVectorDouble`, `VectorVectorInt`, etc...  are automatically converted to/from Python/numpy nd.array of nd.array(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some classes of the *gstlearn* C++ library have been extended in Python:\n",
    "  * Almost all classes are 'stringable' (those which inherit from `AStringable`), that means that you can type the object name in the Python console prompt and hit 'Enter' key to obtain a detailed description of the object content. The same output text is obtained using the `display` method (e.g. `mygrid.display()`)\n",
    "  * Some classes have an additional Python method named `toTL` (i.e. 'to Target Language') that permits to convert an object into the corresponding Python type. For example, the instruction `df = mygrid.toTL()` permits to create a pandas `DataFrame` from a `Db` object. In that case, the newly created `DataFrame` will contain all variables from the Db (but locators and grid parameters (for DbGrid) will be lost)\t"
