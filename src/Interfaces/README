BUG:
- When send NULL in an argument of a R function(Swigged), inside C++ the pointer is not NULL



- Variable created in Python and added to a Database will cause segfault when
  there is a call to the Database in C++(trying to delete AVariable* that was not create in c++):
  
  there is no such problem in R  



info:
  - When Deserialize, variable are read by alphabetical order
    this change the way variable are order in database
    but do not change order in Roles
    User, just use name of Variable to identify Vars(so that doesn't affect any calcul).
    Possibility of adding an netcdf attribute ivar , if we really want the same order.
