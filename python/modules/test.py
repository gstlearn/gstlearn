    This function checks that two vectors contain exactly the same set of values
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    vec1, vec2: two vectors (or matrices) to be compared. They must have the same number of elements
    tolerance: Tolerance used for the comparison
    flagRelative: when True, the values are compared without paying attention to their sign
    flagAbsolute: when True, test is run on absolute difference; otherwise Relative difference

    Remarks
    -------
    When the two vectors do not share the same dimension, the test is not performed
    and a message is printed.
