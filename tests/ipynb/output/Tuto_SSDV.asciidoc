[[introduction]]
= Introduction

This document is meant to give some introductory information on various
tools derived from the geostatistical etimation variance, which have
been developed to measusre the sampling density, either for a regular
sampling design or an irregular one. It follows the paper entitled _From
the Spatial Sampling of a Deposit to Mineral Resources Classification_,
from Jacques Rivoirard, Didier Renard, Felipe Celhay, David Benado,
Celeste Queiroz, Leandro Jose Oliveira, and Diniz Ribeiro, presented in
Geostatistics Valencia 2016.

[[the-concepts]]
== The concepts

In this paper, latexmath:[$Z(x)$] denotes the regionalized (additive)
variable. Considering a domain V, the estimation of latexmath:[$Z(V)$]
by inner samples of latexmath:[$V$] is denoted latexmath:[$Z(V)^*$] and
the corresponding estimation variance latexmath:[$\sigma_E^2 (V)$] which
is calculated from the variogram as follows:
latexmath:[\[\sigma_E^2 (V)={2 \over N} \sum_i \bar \gamma(x_i,V) - {1 \over N^2} \sum_{ij} \gamma(x_i,x_j) - \bar \gamma(V,V)\]]

The spatial sampling density variance (*ssdv*) corresponds is
latexmath:[\[\chi(V) = {\sigma_E^2 (V) \times |V|}\]].

The specific volume measures the density of a spatial sampling of the
variable, relatively to its mean: the smaller the specific volume, the
more precise the sampling pattern:
latexmath:[\[V_0 = { {\sigma_E^2 (V) \times |V|} \over M^2 }\]]

The coefficient of variation for a given Volume is:
latexmath:[\[CoV = \sqrt{ V_0 \over V}\]]

The specific area corresponding to a given CoV (area over which the mean
variable has a given coefficient of variation) is:
latexmath:[\[V = { V_0 \over CoV^2 }\]]

[[application-to-regular-sampling]]
== Application to regular sampling

The previous concepts are be illustrated using the following example.

Consider a large deposit in two dimensions, sampled with regular grid.
the variable of interest is the thickness (with a mean of 10m), a sample
point variance of 10, and a variogram equal to:
latexmath:[\[1 nug(h) + 9sph(h/200m)\]]

Most of the subsequent calculations need the determination of quantities
which involve extension variance, the latter being based on calulation
of average variogram over a block. This operation is performed by
discretization which needs to be specified explicitely:

The extension variance of a latexmath:[$100m \times 100m$] by its center
is:


+*Out[5]:*+
----
Extension Variance = 2.697
----

Therefore, for a latexmath:[$100m \times 100m$] grid, the spatial
sampling density variance is:


+*Out[6]:*+
----
Spatial Sampling Density Variance = 26972.85 m⁴
----

The specific area (i.e. the specific volume in two dimensions) is:

----
Specific Area (case #1) = 269.73 m²

If the grid is now a latexmath:[$50m \times 50m$], the specific volume
becomes:


+*Out[8]:*+
----
Specific Area (small block) = 45.77 m²
----

Another issue is whether the initial latexmath:[$100m \times 100m$] grid
is better, or not, than a latexmath:[$70m \times 70m$] sampling in a
similar deposit, where the thickness has a mean of 8 and a variogram
equal to latexmath:[\[6 nug(h) + 6sph(h/200m)\]]

We can finally characterize resources given an assumption on the
production volume (or more exactly the ore + waste volume to be
extracted). For instance, a specific volume (3) of 6000 m3 gives a CoV
of:


+*Out[11]:*+
----
Coefficient of Variation = 21.20
----

Conversely we can define the specific volume to be mined in order to
ensure a given CoV. For instance we can deduce that the 5% CoV area
(area over which the mean thickness has a coefficient of variation of
5%) must practically reach 200,000 m2, while it is only108,000 m2 in the
first case
