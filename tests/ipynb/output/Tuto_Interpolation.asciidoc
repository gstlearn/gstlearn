[[learning-about-interpolations]]
= Learning about Interpolations

This Tutorial is meant to give some hints about using Interpolation
methods in gstlearn

Setting some global variables

Generating an initial square grid covering a 1 by 1 surface (100 meshes
along each direction).

Creating a Data Set. The set is generated using a non-conditional
geostatistical simulation (performed using the Turning Bands method).
This simulation is first performed on the grid which is then sampled to
constitute the Point Data Set.

In this paragraph, we experiment an interpolation based on Least Square
Polynomial Fit technique. We use a polynomial of degree 1, fitted
locally (on the samples neighboring the target grid node). Note that a
bigger neighborhood had to be defined (more than 5 samples per
neighborhood)
