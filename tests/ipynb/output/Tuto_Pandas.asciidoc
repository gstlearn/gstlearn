== This file demonstrates the conversion of a Db into a Panda

Loading the required libraries

We first create the Data Base 'db' with few samples and 4 variables.

Each of these variables is assigned a Locator.

The next printout shows the contents of the Db using gstlearn format

Data Base Characteristics
=========================

Data Base Summary
-----------------
File is organized as a set of isolated points
Space dimension              = 2
Number of Columns            = 4
Maximum Number of UIDs       = 4
Total number of samples      = 10
Number of active samples     = 3

Variables
---------
Column = 0 - Name = long - Locator = x1
Column = 1 - Name = lat - Locator = x2
Column = 2 - Name = z - Locator = z1
Column = 3 - Name = sel - Locator = sel----

We now convert it into a Panda file

We check its contents using Panda own format

The conversion is performed once more, but keeping track of the locator
information assigned to each variable.

The printout is not modified.

But each variable can show the locator which is attached to it. The
syntax is as follows:
