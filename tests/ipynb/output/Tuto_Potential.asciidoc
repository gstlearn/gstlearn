[[defining-the-information]]
== Defining the Information

Setting some global variables

Defining the data points used as controls

The set of iso-potential data points. Each datum is characterized by its
coordinate and an indicator of the set to which it belongs.

The Gradient information

The 1-D grid covering the field of estimation

The Model is composed of a Gaussian Covariance with a scale 20. The
model must be turned into a Gradient model.

The Neighborhood (although parametrized) should be Unique

[[launching-the-estimation]]
== Launching the Estimation

We launch the calculation of the Potential on the nodes of the grid. The
use of OptDbg statement is maintained for spying the process when
estimating a target node in particular (-1 stands for no control).
