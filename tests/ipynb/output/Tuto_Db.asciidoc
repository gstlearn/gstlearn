[[defining-a-data-set]]
== Defining a Data set

The data is defined by simulating samples at random within a given box.
This study is performed in 2-D but this is not considered as a
limitation.

We now define a vector of 0-1 integer values at random again, according
to a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.2. This vector is
added to the Data Base.
