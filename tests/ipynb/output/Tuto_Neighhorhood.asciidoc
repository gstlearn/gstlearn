Setting some global variables

In this paragraph, we generate a Poisson data set and check various
neighborhoods around one specific node of a regular grid.

Moving Neighborhood
===================
Space dimension = 2
Minimum number of samples           = 1
Maximum number of samples           = 15
Number of angular sectors           = 8
Maximum number of points per sector = 3
Maximum horizontal distance         = 0.3----

[[defining-variable-block-extensions]]
== Defining variable block extensions

In this section, we will generate variables in the Grid which contain
the cell extension: this cell extension replaces the constant value of
the mesh.

The following display shows each block with its center and its cell
extension.
