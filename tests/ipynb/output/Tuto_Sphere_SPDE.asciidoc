[[spde-simulation-on-sphere]]
= SPDE simulation on sphere

_by N. Desassis and D. Renard_

The aim of this tutorial is to show how to use gstlearn to simulate the
solution of

latexmath:[\[(\kappa^2-\Delta_{\mathcal{S}_R})^{\alpha/2}Z = \sigma\mathcal{W}\]]

on the sphere latexmath:[$\mathcal{S}_R$] of radius latexmath:[$R$].

* latexmath:[$\Delta_{{\mathcal{S}_R}}$] is the Laplace-Beltrami
operator, i.e, it acts on each point of the sphere as the usual
Laplacian on the tangent plane at this point.
* latexmath:[$\kappa$] is the inverse of the scale parameter
* latexmath:[$\alpha \geq 2$] is an integer describing the smoothness of
the solution.
* latexmath:[$\mathcal{W}$] is a Gaussian white-noise suitably
normalized such as latexmath:[$\sigma^2$] is the variance of the
solution.

In this notebook, we will define the covariance of Matérn on the sphere,
as the covariance of the solution of this SPDE (other extensions of the
Matérn function are possible). By analogy with the Euclidian case, its
smoothness parameter will be defined by latexmath:[$\nu = \alpha -1$].
To compute the covariance function with respect on the geodetic
distance, one have to use a decomposition on the Legendre polynomial
(see below).

We also treat the more general case
latexmath:[\[P^{1/2}(-\Delta_{\mathcal{S}_R})Z = \sigma\mathcal{W}\]]

where latexmath:[$P$] is a polynom positive on
latexmath:[$\mathbb{R}^+$]

latexmath:[$Qx = e_j$] for an arbitrary index latexmath:[$j$].

[[theoretical-covariance-function]]
=== Theoretical covariance function

The covariance between two points with great-circle distance
latexmath:[$d$] on the sphere of radius latexmath:[$R$] is given by
latexmath:[\[C(d) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=0}^\infty f(i)}\sum_{i=0}^\infty f(i) P_i\left(\cos \frac{d}{R}\right)\]]

where the latexmath:[$P_i$]'s are the Legendre polynomials computed with
the following reccurence formula

latexmath:[\[P_0(x) = 1.\]]

latexmath:[\[P_1(x) = x\]]

latexmath:[\[P_{n+1}(x)=\frac{(2n+1)xP_n(x) - n P_{n-1}(x)}{n+1}\]]

For latexmath:[$n\geq 0$],
latexmath:[\[f(n) = \frac{2 (n + 1)}{ (R^2\kappa^2 + n ( n + 1))^\alpha}\]]

For numerical computations, the sums are truncated at *N*.

There is a slight difference between the theoretical variogram and the
one obtained from the SPDE discretization due to a numerical error on
the variance introduced by the discretization. The comparison of the
covariance shows that this numerical error is rather small :
