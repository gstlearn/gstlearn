= Tutorial for Faulting

This file is meant to demonstrate the use of gstlearn for Faulting. It
is recalled that Faulting is defined in 2-D.

[[defining-the-information]]
== Defining the Information

Setting some global variables

Defining the output grid

Defining the data points

Defining a Model which will serve in simulating the value at the data
points.

Simulate the information at the data points

Define the set of Faults.

Define the Moving Neighborhood (with a maximum of 'nmaxi' samples per
neighborhood) an attach the Faults.

Plot the information

[[calculating-the-variogram]]
== Calculating the Variogram

We define the parameters for the calculation of an omni-directional
variogram. In a first trial, we compute the variogram without taking
faults into account.

Represent the variogram with the number of pairs attached to each lag.

Performing the same variogram calculation, taking the fault into account

Represent the variogram again with the number of pairs attached to each
lag.
