This file is meant to demonstrate the use of gstlearn for performing operations on Grids
Setting some global variables

We first define a 2-D grid with 150 x 100 nodes (unit mes size)

On this grid we simulation (using Turning Bands method) two variables
which will serve as the Top and Bottom for the next steps. For
generality, we have truncated the two surfaces arbitrarily. Note taht we
did not check that the Top surface is located _above_ the Bottom
surface, nor that the masked areas coincide.

Range for Bottom =  90.83105938182158 104.99958543205686
Range for Top =  105.00084191866524 119.10100367815025

We now generate the maps of the Variable to be interpolated, with one
version corresponding to the Top position and another version for the
Bottom position. In order to enhance the interpolation feature, the two
versions of this variable are simulated with different textures: short
range at the Top and much longer range at the Top

We create a 3D grid which covers the variation of the variables Top and
Bot (as simulated above), i.e. from 91 to 119.

We obtain the following statistics on the newly created variable

Variables
---------
Column = 0 - Name = rank - Locator = NA
Column = 1 - Name = x1 - Locator = x1
Column = 2 - Name = x2 - Locator = x2
Column = 3 - Name = x3 - Locator = x3
Column = 4 - Name = Interpolation - Locator = z1
