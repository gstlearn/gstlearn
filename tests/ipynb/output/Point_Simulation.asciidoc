= Generation of points at random

This file provides some illustration of the generation of sets of
Points. We can create the set of Points which covers a Box (in any space
dimension). For sake of demonstration, this is demonstrated in 2-D.

We can create the set by drawing samples at random within the Box
extension


+*Out[2]:*+
----
The number of samples = 1000

We now generate a positive Regionalized variable over a grid that will
serve as a density.

Now we define the set of Points according to different models. The first
one is according to Poisson process (i.e. points randomly located within
a Box.


+*Out[4]:*+
----
Number of samples = 910

We now try the repulsion on the Uniform Poisson


+*Out[5]:*+
----
The number of samples = 200

Combining the repulsion with the regionalized Poisson internsity

Number of samples = 145
