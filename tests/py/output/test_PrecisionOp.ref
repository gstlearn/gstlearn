Small Data Set
==============
(Based on the Turbo Mahing derived from a 3 x 3 grid)
Number of apices =  9
Using the version with explicit Matrix
[0.3343359  0.69837521 0.36030911 0.69837521 1.41913158 0.69837521
 0.36030911 0.69837521 0.3343359 ]
Using the Matrix-free version
[0.3343359  0.69837521 0.36030911 0.69837521 1.41913158 0.69837521
 0.36030911 0.69837521 0.3343359 ]
--> Vectors are identical
