Assigning values into a storage
-------------------------------
Random values are assigned at random locations 5000000 times
- Assigning value to the vector of dimension 100000000
#NO_DIFF# Assignment to vector: 113 ms. (Ref = 120 ms.)
- Assigning value to the square matrix of dimension 10000 x 10000
#NO_DIFF# Assignment to matrix: 73 ms. (Ref = 75 ms.)

Comparing various ways of operating Vectors of Double values
------------------------------------------------------------
Operations are performed 5000 times over vectors of size 30000
- using: sum_i a[i] * b[i]
#NO_DIFF# Product of [] terms: 492 ms. (Ref = 500 ms.)
Result = 47.610578
- using iterators
#NO_DIFF# with iterators: 438 ms. (Ref = 450 ms.)
Result = 47.610578
- using pointers to double
#NO_DIFF# with pointers: 315 ms. (Ref = 320 ms.)
Result = 47.610578
- using VectorHelper
#NO_DIFF# with VectorHelper: 193 ms. (Ref = 200 ms.)
Result = 47.610578
- using VectorHelper (double)
#NO_DIFF# with VectorHelper (double): 193 ms. (Ref = 200 ms.)
Result = 47.610578
- using matrix algebra
#NO_DIFF# with algebra: 1705 ms. (Ref = 1700 ms.)
Result = 47.610578

Testing sorting algorithms
--------------------------
We consider a vector of 10 values and the corresponding vector of ranks
Only the first 5 positions are used
This paragraph is not bench-marked as time consumption is too short
