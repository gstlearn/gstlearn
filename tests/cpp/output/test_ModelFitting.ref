Model used for simulating the Data

Model characteristics
=====================
Space dimension              = 2
Number of variable(s)        = 1
Number of basic structure(s) = 2
Number of drift function(s)  = 0
Number of drift equation(s)  = 0

Covariance Part
---------------
Nugget Effect
- Sill         =      2.000
Spherical
- Sill         =      3.000
- Range        =      0.250
Total Sill     =      5.000
Known Mean(s)     0.000
