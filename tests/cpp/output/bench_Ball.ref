Data Base Summary
-----------------
File is organized as a set of isolated points
Space dimension              = 2
Number of Columns            = 4
Total number of samples      = 100

Variables
---------
Column = 0 - Name = rank - Locator = NA
Column = 1 - Name = x-1 - Locator = x1
Column = 2 - Name = x-2 - Locator = x2
Column = 3 - Name = z - Locator = z1
