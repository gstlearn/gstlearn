This test is meant to test Kriging Efficiency using Moving Neighborhood
- the Output Grid contains 10000 nodes
- the Neighborhood is fixed at nmaxi=20 nsect=8 radius=1.000000
- Various number of samples in the Data Set
- Leaf size for the Ball Tree search (when used) = 30
Nsample =     300 - Leaf =  30
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 447 ms. (Ref = 460 ms.)
Nsample =     300 - Leaf =   0
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 910 ms. (Ref = 900 ms.)
Nsample =    1000 - Leaf =  30
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 495 ms. (Ref = 490 ms.)
Nsample =    1000 - Leaf =   0
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 2675 ms. (Ref = 2540 ms.)
Nsample =   10000 - Leaf =  30
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 940 ms. (Ref = 730 ms.)
Nsample =  100000 - Leaf =  30
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 2357 ms. (Ref = 2100 ms.)
