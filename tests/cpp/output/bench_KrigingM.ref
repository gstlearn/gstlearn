This test is meant to test Kriging using Moving Neighborhood
- the Data Set contains 1000 samples
- the Output Grid contains 10000 nodes
- the Moving Neighborhood is required:
  . Radius dimension = 1.000000
  . Maximum number of neighbors = 20
  . Minimum number of neiNumber of Rowsghbors = 2
  . Number of angular sectors   = 8
  . Maxmimum number of neighbors per sector = 3
  . Leaf Size for Ball Tree algorithm = 30
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 807 ms. (Ref = 1500 ms.)
