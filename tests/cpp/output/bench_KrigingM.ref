This test is meant to test Kriging Efficiency using Moving Neighborhood
- the Output Grid contains 10000 nodes
- Various number of samples in the Data Set
- Leaf size for the Ball Tree search (0: no Ball Tree search)
Nsample =     300 - Leaf =  30 - Time =        478 ms
Nsample =     300 - Leaf =   0 - Time =        998 ms
Nsample =    1000 - Leaf =  30 - Time =        656 ms
Nsample =    1000 - Leaf =   0 - Time =       2943 ms
Nsample =   10000 - Leaf =  30 - Time =       1028 ms
Nsample =  100000 - Leaf =  30 - Time =       2799 ms

Moving Neighborhood
===================
Minimum number of samples           = 2
Maximum number of samples           = 20
Number of angular sectors           = 8
Maximum number of points per sector = 3
Maximum horizontal distance         = 1
#NO_DIFF# Kriging in Moving Neighborhood: 2569 ms. (Ref = 1500 ms.)
