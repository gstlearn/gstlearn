RHS between:
- each active sample (90 out of 100) of the input data base
- each one of the 100000 target sites
(For checking purpose, a Selection has been added)
Statistics are provided on the averaged RHS

Optimized solution
------------------
Input samples are pre-transformed into vector of (anisotropic) space points
Simple loop between each target and the previous vector
