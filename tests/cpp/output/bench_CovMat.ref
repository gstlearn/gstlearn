RHS between:
- each active sample (90 out of 100) of the input data base
- each one of the 100000 target sites
(For checking purpose, a Selection has been added)
Statistics are provided on the averaged RHS

Traditional solution
--------------------
Double loop on the input and output points
#NO_DIFF# Establishing RHS: 1318 ms. (Ref = 3900 ms.)
- Number of samples = 90 / 90
- Minimum  = 0.087682
- Maximum  = 0.269929

Semi_optimized solution
-----------------------
Input samples are pre-transformed into vector of space points
Simple loop between each target and the previous vector
#NO_DIFF# Establishing RHS (semi-optimized): 710 ms. (Ref = 600 ms.)
- Number of samples = 90 / 90
- Minimum  = 0.087682
- Maximum  = 0.269929

Optimized solution
------------------
Input samples are pre-transformed into vector of (anisotropic) space points
Simple loop between each target and the previous vector
#NO_DIFF# Establishing RHS (optimized): 885 ms. (Ref = 300 ms.)
- Number of samples = 90 / 90
- Minimum  = 0.087682
- Maximum  = 0.269929
#NO_DIFF# Writing in mat by row then by col: 332 ms.
#NO_DIFF# Writing in mat by col then by row: 39 ms.
#NO_DIFF# Writing at random: 61 ms.
