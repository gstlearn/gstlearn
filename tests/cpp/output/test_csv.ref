Data Base Characteristics
=========================

Data Base Summary
-----------------
File is organized as a set of isolated points
Space dimension              = 2
Number of Columns            = 5
Maximum Number of UIDs       = 5
Total number of samples      = 102

Data Base Extension
-------------------
Coor #1 - Min =    109.850 - Max =    143.010 - Ext = 33.16
Coor #2 - Min =    483.660 - Max =    513.040 - Ext = 29.38

Variables
---------
Column = 0 - Name = rank - Locator = NA
Column = 1 - Name = X - Locator = x1
Column = 2 - Name = Y - Locator = x2
Column = 3 - Name = Zn - Locator = z1
Column = 4 - Name = Pb - Locator = p1

Look for duplicates
-------------------
Sample 49 too close to sample 48
Sample #49 (from 102)
Coordinate #1 = 110.120000
Coordinate #2 = 486.730000
Sample #48 (from 102)
Coordinate #1 = 110.320000
Coordinate #2 = 487.010000

- Count of masked samples = 1
