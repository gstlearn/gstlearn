**Variogram Cloud**

The data is modeled as *samples of a regionalized* variable $z$, i.e. as evaluations at locations $x_1,..,x_n$ of a variable $z$ defined across a spatial domain: 
$$\lbrace z_i = z(x_i) : i = 1, ..., n\rbrace.$$

The variogram cloud is the set of pair of points defined as
$$ \big\lbrace \big( \Vert x_i - x_j\Vert,  \big\vert z(x_i)-z(x_j)\big\vert^2 \big) \quad\text{where}\quad 1\le i\le j\le n \big\rbrace $$

In **gstlearn**, variogram clouds are computed as grids.

**Experimental Variogram**

The experimental (isotropic) variogram $\gamma$ is a  function defined as

$$\gamma(h)=\frac{1}{2\vert N(h)\vert}\sum_{(i,j) \in N(h)}\big\vert z(x_i)-z(x_j)\big\vert^2, \quad h\ge 0,$$

where $N(h)$ is set of all pairs of data points separated by a distance $h$ (called *lag*):
$$ N(h) = \bigg\lbrace (i,j) : \Vert x_j-x_i\Vert = h\bigg\rbrace_{1\le i\le j\le n},$$

and $\vert N(h)\vert$ is the cardinal of $N(h)$. In practice, when computing $\gamma(h)$, we look for pairs of data points separated by a distance $h \pm \tau h$ where $\tau > 0$ is a tolerance on the separation distance $h$. In other words, $N(h)$ is replaced by
$$ \widehat N(h) = \bigg\lbrace (i,j) : (1-\tau)h \le \Vert x_j-x_i\Vert \le (1+\tau) h\bigg\rbrace_{1\le i\le j\le n}$$

To compute an experimental variogram, we start by creating a `VarioParam` object containing the parameters of the variogram. This is done using the function `VarioParam_createOmniDirection`. We can specify the number of lags $h$ for which the experimental variogram is computed (argument `npas`), and the distance between these lags (argument `dpas`), as well as the tolerance $\tau$ on the lags (argument `toldis`).

Then, the experimental variogram is computed in two steps. First, a `Vario` object is initialized from the `VarioParam` object  and the `Db` containing the data points. Then, the values of the experimental variogram at the lags specified by  the `VarioParam` object  are computed using the method `compute` of the `Vario` object (which returns an error code, `0` meaning that no error was detected).

Note : The variable $z$ for which we wish to define the experimental variogram should be the only variable in the `Db` with a `z` locator (i.e. it should have locator `z1` and the other variables should not have a locator starting with `z`). This can be done bu using the method `setLocator` of the `Db` object containing the data. If several variables with `z` locators are present in the `Db`, then cross-variograms between are also computed (this subject will be covered in the course on multivariate analysis). 

In the next example, we compute an experimental variogram with $40$ lags separated by a distance $10$ (meaning that we take $h =10i$ for $i=0, ..., 39$), and consider a tolerance $\tau = 10\%$ for the variogram computations. We use the `Db` `dat`, and select the variable `January_temp` as our variable of interest (by setting its locator to "z").

**Directional Variogram**

The experimental directional variogram $\gamma$ is a  function defined as
$$\gamma(\theta,h)=\frac{1}{2\vert N(\theta, h)\vert}\sum_{(i,j) \in N(\theta, h)}\big\vert z(x_i)-z(x_j)\big\vert^2, \quad 0^{\circ}\le \theta <360^{\circ}, \quad h\ge 0$$

where $N(\theta, h)$ is set of all pairs of data points separated by a vector of size $h$ and along the direction $\theta$ (in degrees):
$$ N(\theta, h) = \bigg\lbrace (i,j) : \Vert x_j-x_i\Vert = h \quad\text{and the vector } \vec{u}=(x_j-x_i) \text{ is along the direction } \theta\bigg\rbrace_{1\le i\le j\le n},$$

In practice, when computing $\gamma(\theta, h)$, we once gain consider a tolerance $\tau$ on the separation distance $h$, and also consider a tolerance $\eta>0$ is also considered for the direction angle. In other words, $N(h)$ is replaced by
 $$\widehat N(\theta, h) = \bigg\lbrace (i,j) : (1-\tau)h \le \Vert x_j-x_i\Vert \le (1+\tau) h \quad\text{and the vector } \vec{u}=(x_j-x_i) \text{ is along the direction } \theta \pm \eta \bigg\rbrace_{1\le i\le j\le n},$$
 
 Much like their isotropic counterparts, experimental directional variograms are computed as `Vario` objects, which can be created from he `VarioParam` object (containing the parameters of the variogram) and a `Db` containing the data points. 

This time, the `VarioParam` object is created using the function `VarioParam_createMultiple`. There, we specify the number $K$ of directions $\theta$ for which we wish to compute the an experimental variogram (argument `ndir`), as well as the reference angle $\theta_0$ of the first direction (argument `angref`, default = $0$) so that the directions $\theta$ = $\theta_0 + i(180/K)$ for $i=0,..., K-1$ are considered. We can also specify the number of lags $h$ for which the experimental variogram is computed (argument `npas`), and the distance between these lags (argument `npas`), as well as the tolerance $\tau$ on the lags (argument `toldis`). Then, the experimental variogram is computed just as in the isotropic case.

Note: When initializing the `VarioParam` object as described above, the angle tolerance $\eta$ is automatically set to $\eta = (90/K)$, meaning that we span the set of possible directions.

In the following example, we create an experimental variogram in the $4$ directions $\theta = 0^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 135^{\circ}$.

**Variogram Map**

The experimental variogram map is a map centered at the origin, which represents the value of experimental directional variogram across all directions $0^{\circ} \le \theta< 360^{\circ}$.

To compute an experimental variogram map, we use the function `db_vmap_compute` which we supply with the `Db` containing the data. The output is a `Db` containing a grid representing the variogram map values.
